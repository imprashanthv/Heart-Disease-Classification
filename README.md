# Heart-Disease-Classification
Classified health data of nearly 300 patients with 13 datapoints as having a heart disease or not. Visualization rich analysis and created predictive models. 

## Summary of Findings:
#### The age distribution looks to be typical, with the bulk of the patients in their 50s. 
#### Male patients consult at a higher rate than female patients in every age group. 
#### The number of male patients with the condition was greater than the number of female patients. 
#### Outliers in four criteria have to be removed. 
#### As classification models, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM were employed. 
#### The nearest neighbor distance is used by KNN to classify diseases. The nearest neighbor count was set at seven in this case. 
#### Random Forest is an ensemble model, meaning it is made up of a variety of decision trees. As per the theory, a random forest (a collection of decision trees) would outperform a single decision tree because the result is coming from a combination of decision trees.
#### The odds are used in logistic regression. 
#### Based on the judgments made at each node, the decision tree creates a categorization flow. 
#### For logistic regression and decision tree, the default settings are left untouched. 
#### To separate the datapoints, SVM uses a hyperplane. The parameters for SVM were adjusted as follows:Â C: 0.8, gamma:'auto,' and probability was set to True to plot ROC curves.
